# Flower Image Classifier - CNN
# 

This project consists of the ipynb file that has 3 different models built to classify 5 different flowers(Rose, Dandelion, Sunflower, Daisy, Tulip) from an image. The three different models and their performance are represented in this project. A simple CNN model architecture, a deeper regularized CNN model architecture and a Transfer Learning based ResNet50 model Architecture. The performance of each of the model are evaluated and based on the tes t accuracy obtained, ResNet model was 85% accurate with the prediction,  Simple CNN model with 75% accuracy and lastly the Deeper Regularized CNN model with 63% accuracy.
