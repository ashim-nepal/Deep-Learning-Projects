## Image Classifier Application
# 

This project consists of the files that I have created with a simple cnn model to classify various images using CIFAR-10 image dataset. The aqpplication is designed using streamlit and the prediction of the images can be done using the deployed web application.

You can Access the application by clicking the link here: [Application](https://deep-learning-projects-image-classifier.streamlit.app/)

! Please Note that, the site might take a while to load and you may need to get the app back up in Streamlit. Thank You!



## Acknowledgements

- I would also like to thank all the awesome coders who have contributed different things about Python, AI and Streamlit in the internet from where I took guidance.
- I express my deepest appreciation and thank you to all those who helped me either directly or indirectly in this project.
