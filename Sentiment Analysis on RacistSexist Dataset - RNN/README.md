# Sentiment Analysis on RacistSexist Dataset - RNN
# 

This project consists of the ipynb file that has 3 different models built to make sentiment analysis on whether the text is Racist/Sexist or not. There are 3 different models built that helps to predict the analysis. The models are, simple RNN model, LSTM model and LSTM with word2Vec embedding. Based on the models designed and evaluating, the accuracy of each of the models are, 95.8%, 96.3% and 95.0% respectively.

! Please Note that, the site might take a while to load and you may need to get the app back up in Streamlit. Thank You!
